Counting the number of characters is important because 
almost all the text boxes that rely on user input have a certain limit on the number of characters that can be inserted.
For example, If the file is small, you can use readlines() 
or an A loop approach. If you have a lot of files to work with To determine
line count, use the Generator and Raw interface,  
If you donâ€™t want to 
load the complete file in, utilize a
loop and enumerate() for huge files. 
This program in Data file handling in Python emphasizes counting the number 
of lines in a text file in Python.
